Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
 .main {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: auto;
    overflow: hidden;
}    
  
 .box-one {
    grid-column: 1/3;

}
  
  @media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    .box-one {
        grid-column: 1/1;
}

```

### Continued development

I will continue studying and delving deeper into the GRID concepts, because it was the point where I had the most difficulty understanding, I've already noticed a lot of evolution in Flex Box, but I need to continue practicing in future projects!


### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid](https://blog.matheuscastiglioni.com.br/criando-layouts-com-css-grid-layout/) - This site is amazing and very dynamic for learning Grid
